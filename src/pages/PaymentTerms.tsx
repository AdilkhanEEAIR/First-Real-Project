            <p className="mb-4">
              For most of our packages and individual services, we operate on a two-phase payment structure to ensure mutual commitment and satisfaction:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>50% Upfront Payment:</strong> A deposit of 50% of the total service fee is required before the commencement of any work. This secures your project slot and allows us to allocate resources and begin strategic planning.</li>
              <li><strong>50% Upon Completion:</strong> The remaining 50% of the payment is due upon the successful completion of the agreed-upon services and client approval. We ensure all deliverables meet your expectations before final payment is requested.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">2. Payment Plans for Ultimate Packages</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              For our comprehensive Ultimate Package, we understand the investment involved and offer more flexible payment options:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>3-Month Payment Plan:</strong> Clients opting for the Ultimate Package can choose a 3-month payment plan. This typically involves an initial deposit followed by two equal monthly installments. Specific terms will be detailed in your service agreement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">3. Accepted Payment Methods</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We accept various secure payment methods, which will be communicated during the invoicing process.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">4. Invoicing and Due Dates</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Invoices will be issued electronically with clear due dates. Timely payment ensures uninterrupted service delivery. Late payments may incur additional fees as outlined in your service agreement.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">5. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
